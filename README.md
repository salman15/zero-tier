# ZeroTier assignment

I've implemented a `simple browser-based UI + device listing data` that has the following features:

- Uses an `ACCESS_TOKEN` to connect to the zero tier api
- List of available network devices
- Insights into available networks devices

## Tech used

I've used the following tech:

- React
- ViteJS
- TailwindCSS
- Twin.Macro
- DaisyUI
- TypeScript
- Emotion

Because it was asked in the assignment and my preferred JS framework I've used `React` with `TypeScript`. I've used `ViteJS` for it's performance during development, `TailwindCSS` for because it's flexibility and speed when setting up new apps. `Twin.Macro` because it's prevents cluttering in the classnames and DaisyUI to once again speed up setting up an UI.
